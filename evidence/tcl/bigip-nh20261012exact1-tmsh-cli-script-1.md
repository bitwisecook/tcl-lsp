# BIG-IP tmsh Tcl: nh20261012exact1, tmsh-cli-script-1

## Question

This script contains the following cases, which investigate Tcl name handling relevant to the LSP, compiler and VM. Each observation is limited to its own case and this execution context.

- **computed-binding-mutation:** When a command name is assembled into a variable and the command at that name is replaced, does executing the unchanged variable use the original or the replacement binding?

## Assumptions

- **computed-binding-mutation:** Entire-program evaluation stage only; capture ownership-guard completion does not by itself establish completion of the original program's setup prefix. Final intended lookup reachability is recorded separately. Intended operation: not recorded.

Other assumptions were not separately recorded.

## Script

Fixture: [bigip-tmsh-cli-script-1](fixtures/bigip-tmsh-cli-script-1.md)

- case: `computed-binding-mutation`

### nh_setup

```tcl-visible
set nh_guard_scope [namespace current]
set nh_guard_procs {}
set nh_guard_absent {}
foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
    if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name] || [llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {error [list ownership-collision namespace-or-command $nh_guard_name]}
    lappend nh_guard_absent [list namespace-and-command $nh_guard_name]
}
foreach nh_guard_tail {} {
    set nh_guard_name [string trimright $nh_guard_scope :]::$nh_guard_tail
    if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]] || [string length [namespace which -command $nh_guard_tail]]} {error [list ownership-collision procedure $nh_guard_name resolved [namespace which -command $nh_guard_tail]]}
    lappend nh_guard_procs $nh_guard_name
    lappend nh_guard_absent [list procedure $nh_guard_name fallback $nh_guard_tail]
}
foreach nh_guard_name {} {
    if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name] || [llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {error [list ownership-collision command-or-namespace $nh_guard_name]}
    lappend nh_guard_procs $nh_guard_name
    lappend nh_guard_absent [list command-and-namespace $nh_guard_name]
}
foreach nh_guard_name {ns head} {
    if {[info exists $nh_guard_name] || [llength [info vars $nh_guard_name]] || [llength [trace vinfo $nh_guard_name]]} {error [list ownership-collision frame-variable $nh_guard_name]}
    lappend nh_guard_absent [list frame-variable $nh_guard_name]
}
list ownership-guard execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope absent $nh_guard_absent
```

### nh_operation

```tcl-visible
namespace eval ::nh {proc emit {} {return first}}
set ns ::nh
set head ${ns}::emit
rename ::nh::emit ::nh::old
proc ::nh::emit {} {return replacement}
$head

```

### nh_cleanup

```tcl-visible
if {$nh_setup_code == 0} {
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {rename $nh_guard_name {}}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {namespace delete $nh_guard_name}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {ns head} {unset -nocomplain $nh_guard_name}
    set nh_guard_remaining {}
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list command $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list namespace $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {ns head} {
        if {[info exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list frame-variable $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    list ownership-cleanup execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope remaining $nh_guard_remaining
} else {
    list ownership-not-acquired original-source-unreached
}
```
