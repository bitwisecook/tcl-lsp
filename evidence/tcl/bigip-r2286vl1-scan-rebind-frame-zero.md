# BIG-IP variable lifecycle: scan-rebind-frame-zero

## Question

Can a trace on the first scan output use upvar 0 to rebind the second output in the same event frame? This constrains output-variable lookup and link lifetime in the compiler and VM.

## Assumptions

The payload was evaluated under catch in an HTTP_REQUEST event, sequentially with 60 other cases in the same event frame. Earlier cases can affect later cases, so the results do not assume a fresh interpreter or unset variables. The script's own nested catch and hex encoding, where present, remain part of the result. The observations are limited to the recorded context and inputs. The immediately preceding case was [lappend-zero-recreate](bigip-r2286vl1-lappend-zero-recreate.md).

## Script

```tcl-visible
proc hex {s} {binary scan $s H* out; return $out}
set c [catch {set replacement BEFORE; set first INIT; set second ORIGINAL; proc watch {n k op} {uplevel 1 {upvar 0 replacement second}}; trace variable first w watch; set n first; set m second; set h scan; set count [$h {7 9} {%d %d} $n $m]; list $count $first $second $replacement} r]
set summary [list $c [hex $r]]
set summary
```
