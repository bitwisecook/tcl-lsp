# BIG-IP variable lifecycle: active-scalar

## Question

When a scalar read trace unsets and recreates its variable during lappend, which value does the active operation use and which trace callbacks survive? This constrains variable-cell lifetime in the compiler and VM.

## Assumptions

The payload was evaluated under catch in an HTTP_REQUEST event, sequentially with 60 other cases in the same event frame. Earlier cases can affect later cases, so the results do not assume a fresh interpreter or unset variables. The script's own nested catch and hex encoding, where present, remain part of the result. The observations are limited to the recorded context and inputs.

## Script

```tcl-visible
set events {}; set v OLD
proc watch {n k op} {upvar 1 events events; lappend events $op; if {$op eq "read"} {uplevel 1 {unset v; set v NEW}}}
trace add variable v {read unset} watch
set h lappend
set answer [$h v EXTRA]
set summary [list $answer [set v] $events [trace info variable v]]
set summary
```
