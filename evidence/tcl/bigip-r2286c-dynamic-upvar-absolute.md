# BIG-IP original runtime: dynamic upvar absolute

## Question

Does upvar #0 link a procedure-local name to the selected global variable? This constrains variable links and frame resolution in the LSP, compiler and VM.

## Assumptions

The installed HTTP_REQUEST wrapper evaluated this exact script under catch. Repeated requests can share interpreter state, so later results need not match earlier results; counts are captured log lines, not proof of isolated invocations. The wrapper's errorCode field can reflect existing interpreter state. Results are limited to this context and inputs.

## Script

```tcl-visible
set ::__tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_x GLOBAL
proc __tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_read {} {upvar #0 ::__tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_x a; set a CHANGED; return $a}
list [__tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_read] [set ::__tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_x]⟦EOF⟧
```

## Results
