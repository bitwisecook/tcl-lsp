# BIG-IP original runtime: dynamic upvar

## Question

Does upvar 1 link a callee's local name to its caller's variable? This constrains caller-frame variable links in the LSP, compiler and VM.

## Assumptions

The installed HTTP_REQUEST wrapper evaluated this exact script under catch. Repeated requests can share interpreter state, so later results need not match earlier results; counts are captured log lines, not proof of isolated invocations. The wrapper's errorCode field can reflect existing interpreter state. Results are limited to this context and inputs.

## Script

```tcl-visible
proc __tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_inner {n} {upvar 1 $n a; set a 9}
proc __tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_outer {} {set x 1; __tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_inner x; return $x}
__tcl_lsp_probe_2286_r2286_20261006c_outer⟦EOF⟧
```

## Results

### TMM unit 0, captured result 1

- Recorded version: BIG-IP 21.1.0.1 build 0.0.26; Tcl patchlevel Not recorded.
- Recorded input channel: HTTP_REQUEST.
- Exit status: Not recorded.
- Standard output: Not recorded.
- Standard error: Not recorded.
- Recorded result:

```text-visible
9⟦EOF⟧
```

The wrapper recorded Tcl completion code 0 in 34 log lines. Its recorded errorCode field was:

```text-visible
UNAVAILABLE⟦EOF⟧
```

### TMM unit 1, captured result 2; TMM unit 2, captured result 3

- Recorded version: BIG-IP 21.1.0.1 build 0.0.26; Tcl patchlevel Not recorded.
- Recorded input channel: HTTP_REQUEST.
- Exit status: Not recorded.
- Standard output: Not recorded.

- Recorded result:

```text-visible
9⟦EOF⟧
```

The wrapper recorded Tcl completion code 0 in 32 log lines. Its recorded errorCode field was:

```text-visible
