# BIG-IP APL callback: tcltest-shared-lifecycle

## Question

Do tcltest setup, body and cleanup share the expected namespace variable state, and is the setup variable absent after cleanup?

This callback addresses only the `tcltest-shared-lifecycle` case in that broader question. Its result can inform name resolution and diagnostics in the LSP, compiler and VM, but does not establish the behavior of other cases or environments.

## Assumptions

Recorded case scope: Complete byte-identical original source evaluated in the retained host wrapper's actual namespace/frame. Ownership guard precedes the entire program; cleanup deletes only original exact names proven absent. Whole-program completion does not by itself prove that a particular nested/final lookup was reached.

Other assumptions were not separately recorded. The APL callback was selected through the browser; this is not an iApp implementation, an iRule, or a stock Tcl measurement. A successful caught cleanup does not prove that every cleanup operation succeeded.

### nh_setup

```tcl-visible
set nh_guard_scope [namespace current]
set nh_guard_procs {}
set nh_guard_absent {}
foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
    if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name] || [llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {error [list ownership-collision namespace-or-command $nh_guard_name]}
    lappend nh_guard_absent [list namespace-and-command $nh_guard_name]
}
foreach nh_guard_tail {} {
    set nh_guard_name [string trimright $nh_guard_scope :]::$nh_guard_tail
    if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]] || [string length [namespace which -command $nh_guard_tail]]} {error [list ownership-collision procedure $nh_guard_name resolved [namespace which -command $nh_guard_tail]]}

}
list ownership-guard execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope absent $nh_guard_absent
```

### nh_operation

```tcl-visible
package require tcltest
namespace eval ::nh {
    namespace import ::tcltest::*
    set observed {}
    test name-corpus-1 {} -setup {
        set payload {a b}
    } -body {
        lappend observed [set payload]
    } -cleanup {
        lappend observed [set payload]
        unset payload
    } -result {{a b}}
}
list $::nh::observed [info exists ::nh::payload]

```

### nh_cleanup

```tcl-visible
if {$nh_setup_code == 0} {
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {rename $nh_guard_name {}}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {namespace delete $nh_guard_name}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {unset -nocomplain $nh_guard_name}
    set nh_guard_remaining {}
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list command $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {::nh} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list namespace $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {
        if {[info exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list frame-variable $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    list ownership-cleanup execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope remaining $nh_guard_remaining
} else {
    list ownership-not-acquired original-source-unreached
}
```
