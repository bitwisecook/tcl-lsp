# BIG-IP cross-context naming: commands format

## Question

How are precomposed and decomposed command names produced by format %c created and resolved? This affects command-name modeling in the LSP, compiler and VM.

## Assumptions

The retained payload was evaluated under catch inside context-specific wrappers. Result bytes below are the wrapper's recorded Tcl result, rather than standalone process stdout. A result in one context does not establish another context or version. Other assumptions were not separately recorded.

## Script

Fixture: [bigip-tmm-traffic-event-12](fixtures/bigip-tmm-traffic-event-12.md)

- run: `r2286p_command_format_`
