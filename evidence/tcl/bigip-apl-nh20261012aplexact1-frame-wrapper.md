# BIG-IP APL callback: frame-wrapper

## Question

Does a forwarding procedure using uplevel 1 let a subsequent upvar 1 reach a spaced variable name in the original caller's frame?

This callback addresses only the `frame-wrapper` case in that broader question. Its result can inform name resolution and diagnostics in the LSP, compiler and VM, but does not establish the behavior of other cases or environments.

## Assumptions

Recorded case scope: Complete byte-identical original source evaluated in the retained host wrapper's actual namespace/frame. Ownership guard precedes the entire program; cleanup deletes only original exact names proven absent. Whole-program completion does not by itself prove that a particular nested/final lookup was reached.

Other assumptions were not separately recorded. The APL callback was selected through the browser; this is not an iApp implementation, an iRule, or a stock Tcl measurement. A successful caught cleanup does not prove that every cleanup operation succeeded.

### nh_setup

```tcl-visible

foreach nh_guard_name {} {
    if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name] || [llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {error [list ownership-collision namespace-or-command $nh_guard_name]}

    lappend nh_guard_absent [list frame-variable $nh_guard_name]
}
list ownership-guard execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope absent $nh_guard_absent
```

### nh_operation

```tcl-visible
proc forward {prefix} {uplevel 1 $prefix}
proc change {name} {upvar 1 $name cell; set cell changed}
proc outer {} {
    set {a b} original
    forward [list change {a b}]
    set {a b}
}
outer

```

### nh_cleanup

```tcl-visible
if {$nh_setup_code == 0} {
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {rename $nh_guard_name {}}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {namespace delete $nh_guard_name}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {unset -nocomplain $nh_guard_name}
    set nh_guard_remaining {}
    foreach nh_guard_name $nh_guard_procs {
        if {[llength [info commands $nh_guard_name]]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list command $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {
        if {[namespace exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list namespace $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    foreach nh_guard_name {} {
        if {[info exists $nh_guard_name]} {lappend nh_guard_remaining [list frame-variable $nh_guard_name]}
    }
    list ownership-cleanup execution-namespace $nh_guard_scope remaining $nh_guard_remaining
} else {
    list ownership-not-acquired original-source-unreached
}
```
