# naming.return-option-pairs-release-shape

Kind: `native-observation`

## Problem statement

Pair count, release-specific option availability and the procedure boundary determine Return semantics. A sole dynamic value cannot be donated to an option-selector role.

## Question

How do the original return -code and -level pairs differ from a sole dynamic option-looking result?

## Conclusion

C8.4 rejects the -level pair in the captured sources while later C and Jim accept it; a sole dynamic -code remains the ordinary result on all six. Exact boundary-settled results remain distinct from private raw completion storage.

## Scope

Five original option-pair/sole-dynamic sources from option_pair_source.tcl, six captured providers.

No native observation for this precise question and provider is attached; no result is inferred from another dialect, source channel or record.

## Exact evidence

- `receipt-0` (observation): [rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/option_pair_manifest.json](../../../../rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/option_pair_manifest.json). SHA-256 `ea1fd9152c46d8b1eab74feebb23202286a564690389d7167dc29b13cd7e7698`. Exact recovered input/provider/observation record; initial failed observer attempts, where present, are retained as harness limitations.
- `artifact-1` (input): [rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/option_pair_source.tcl](../../../../rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/option_pair_source.tcl).

Per-question scope selects the relevant producer/case ranges; adjacent streams are not automatically equivalent.
- `artifact-2` (input): [rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/source.tcl](../../../../rust/tcl-registry/tests/data/native_return_single_result/source.tcl). SHA-256 `928761b316e4bd61a979c8d6f41597fa756b1e237d69b15411cdd94de70093fd`. Retained exact input/observation bytes. Per-question scope selects the relevant producer/case ranges; adjacent streams are not automatically equivalent.
- `maintained-source-replayer` (implementation): [scripts/dev/replay-grammar-native-source.py](../../../../scripts/dev/replay-grammar-native-source.py). SHA-256 `50e5b50aa05b55c5bfcf5e88981d7ccd8da4a3f418a290f3f457c7734e4764bc`. Maintained source-only replay adapter; no fresh native execution is recorded by this contribution.

## Source inspection

No implementation source excerpt is attached. Native outputs do not supply an implementation explanation.

## Consumer bindings

No implementation binding is claimed by this observation record.

A named test is a coverage binding, not a claim that it executed.

## Replay

Recorded argument vector:

```json
[
  "python3",
  "scripts/dev/replay-grammar-native-source.py",
  "--proof",
  "naming.return-option-pairs-release-shape",
  "--provider",
  "8.4",
  "--executable",
  "/path/to/exact/recorded/provider",
  "--output",
  "/tmp/name-resolution-source-replay"
]
```

Select each observed provider explicitly. The driver pins retained evidence bytes, checks independently launched patchlevel, preserves original source/wrapper bytes, compares process exit/stdout/stderr and writes a fresh provider receipt outside the repository. The shared two-slot limit and60-second timeout remain unchanged. Guest errors inside a catch are expected data. This driver replays source-only observations; it supplies no private-header or original-object identity evidence.
