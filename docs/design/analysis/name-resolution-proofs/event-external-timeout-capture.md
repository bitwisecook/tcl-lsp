# naming.event.external-timeout-capture

Kind: `native-observation`

## Problem statement

A blocked notifier or wrong-arity handler cannot be recorded as a returned guest error.

## Question

Which isolated NO_SOURCES and wrong-arity PREFIX_BGERROR processes actually complete, and what evidence exists for the abandoned v105 runner?

## Conclusion

v106 NO_SOURCES hits the two-second external deadline on all five C providers; no guest completion/result row exists. Its Jim process returns OK with an empty result. PREFIX_BGERROR hits the external deadline on C85/C86/C90/C91; C84/Jim complete with setup errors. v105 retains only its inputs, runner and C84 compile streams: the runner did not preserve TimeoutExpired streams or a process receipt, so it supplies no observed guest answer.

## Scope

External subprocess observations and their retained partial streams, deadlines, return status and setup results. The timeout limit is outside the interpreter. No would-wait-forever guest result, native unavailability or observed callback completion is inferred. C84 Tcl_GetReturnOptions is absent; Jim C return-options API is not queried; corresponding rows remain explicitly not-tested. Raw receipts and prior attempts remain immutable.

## Consumer bindings

No implementation binding is claimed by this observation record.

A named test is a coverage binding, not a claim that it executed.

## Replay

This record replays no interpreter. Original compile/run commands, input lengths, deadline status and source/header/library/executable hashes are retained in immutable receipts. Captured output directories and original absolute provisioning paths must not be overwritten. Source inspection can be reproduced from the attached full-file and exact LF/snippet hashes. No Rust execution claim.
