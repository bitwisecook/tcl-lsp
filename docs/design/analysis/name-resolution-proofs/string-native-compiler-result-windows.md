# naming.string-native-compiler-result-windows

Kind: `native-observation`

## Problem statement

A string operation result may reuse an operand or a pooled execution constant and thereby alter later residency. The original compiler result window is not the same as a fresh getter or semantic value alone.

## Question

Which native instruction/result-header windows do the sixty original string cases retain under the separately pinned observer?

## Conclusion

The successful separately pinned captures preserve the60 exact case windows and selected streq/strmatch instructions. Cases run in order in one interpreter, so earlier result observation can affect later pooled residency. Failed initial builds and a separately retained crashing C84 observer are retained as limitations, not successful native evidence.

## Scope

Five C builds with matching private compiler headers. Current probe/cases/windows and full manifest, including initial observer failures; physical counts apply only at these named windows.

## Source inspection

No implementation source excerpt is attached. Native outputs do not supply an implementation explanation.

## Consumer bindings

No implementation binding is claimed by this observation record.

A named test is a coverage binding, not a claim that it executed.

## Replay

Original producer code/inputs and captured invocation metadata are pinned above. Restore the exact named provider build and run the original probe with its matching public/private headers and library, preserving its observer order and the60-second/two-slot limits. Recorded absolute executable/output paths are metadata, not usable current paths. Original host probes absent from a corpus remain unreplayable; no source is reconstructed from a digest. Maintained source-only replay instructions are supplied separately where available.
