# naming.tcl84-random-and-precision-controls

Kind: `native-observation`

## Problem statement

Random stream and precision belong to an interpreter and to the time a Double first receives a string. Sharing another interpreter stream or recomputing a retained string under later precision can change the value.

## Question

How do seeded random calls and lazy precision stringification behave in the exact Tcl8.4 source?

## Conclusion

The retained format-random source/output supports the measured Tcl8.4 seeded sequence and precision timing only. Authored simulation defaults remain explicit model choices; no BIG-IP or host interpreter stream is inferred.

## Scope

Single C8.4 provider; exact format-random.tcl and format-random84.txt, ordinary guest operations and captured executable identity.

## Provider answers

### tcl8.4

Status: `observed`. Version: 8.4 (retained corpus; patchlevel not recorded in this row). Build: Recorded executable SHA-256 551bef3a9b51f256f4ad9dec06bddc42ceab872a72528e83676d1d7df715b9d4. Channel: Original ASCII script passed to the recorded native shell.. Dialect: Tcl.

The complete original source/output is retained with process exit 0. Its exact function/diagnostic/result rows answer the scoped question; no other release is inferred.

### tcl8.5

Status: `not-tested`. Version: not recorded. Build: not recorded. Channel: not recorded. Dialect: Tcl.

No native observation for this precise question and provider is attached; no result is inferred from another dialect, source channel or record.

### tcl8.6

Status: `not-tested`. Version: not recorded. Build: not recorded. Channel: not recorded. Dialect: Tcl.

No native observation for this precise question and provider is attached; no result is inferred from another dialect, source channel or record.

### tcl9.0

Status: `not-tested`. Version: not recorded. Build: not recorded. Channel: not recorded. Dialect: Tcl.

No native observation for this precise question and provider is attached; no result is inferred from another dialect, source channel or record.

### tcl9.1

Status: `not-tested`. Version: not recorded. Build: not recorded. Channel: not recorded. Dialect: Tcl.

No native observation for this precise question and provider is attached; no result is inferred from another dialect, source channel or record.

### jim

## Source inspection

No implementation source excerpt is attached. Native outputs do not supply an implementation explanation.

## Consumer bindings

No implementation binding is claimed by this observation record.

A named test is a coverage binding, not a claim that it executed.

## Replay

Recorded argument vector:

```json
[
  "python3",
  "scripts/dev/replay-grammar-native-source.py",
  "--proof",
  "naming.tcl84-random-and-precision-controls",
  "--provider",
  "8.4",
  "--executable",
  "/path/to/exact/recorded/provider",
  "--output",
  "/tmp/name-resolution-source-replay"
]
```

Select each observed provider explicitly. The driver pins retained evidence bytes, checks independently launched patchlevel, preserves original source/wrapper bytes, compares process exit/stdout/stderr and writes a fresh provider receipt outside the repository. The shared two-slot limit and60-second timeout remain unchanged. Guest errors inside a catch are expected data. This driver replays source-only observations; it supplies no private-header or original-object identity evidence.
