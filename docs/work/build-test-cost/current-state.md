# Build and test cost: current state

Updated 5 November 2026. This file is a current snapshot of the build- and
test-time work on `work`; git records the sequence. The measurements and the
ranked plan it works through are in the report
<https://claude.ai/artifact/BFfNK69TYvCcQMzTRqQLKi> (private; ask the owner
for access).

## Items, in priority order

| # | Item | State | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Long-tail tests driven by `tcl` CLI start-up | **Landed**: reused CLI workers for `rust/tcl-cli/tests` | `rust/tcl-cli-support/src/{worker,sink}.rs`, test-tiers contract rule 9 |
| 2 | `rust-check` is one serial 16-minute job | **Landed, awaiting first CI run**: `cargo xtask batch`/`make xtask-gates`; `rust-check` split into `lint` and `drift` matrix legs | `rust/xtask/src/main.rs`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/dev/test-pr-gate-path.sh` |
| 3 | Repository weight on `work` | **Landed**: the evidence prune (`8ab317a`) took the tree from 10.7 GB to 0.34 GB; `make check-tracked-size` in `xtask-check` keeps it there | `scripts/dev/check-tracked-size.py`, `scripts/dev/test_tracked_size.py` |
| 4 | Monolithic crates compiled twice | **Landed**: the emitters split into `tcl-codegen`; test parity with the base proven | `rust/tcl-codegen`, `docs/design/contracts/project-layout.md` |
| 5 | Hundreds of fat test binaries | Not started | |
| 6 | Broken and racing CI caches | Not started (item 2 gives each `rust-check` leg its own cache key) | |
| 7 | Exhaustive checks in unoptimised unit tests | Not started | |
| 8 | Version stamp reruns on every cargo call | Not started | |
| 9 | Duplicate WASM builds | Not started | |
| 10 | Runner queueing in bursts | Not started | |

## Baseline state of `work` (`84ddae4`), independent of this work

Recorded so a failure here is not mistaken for a regression from it:

- `tcl-cli` integration tests fail in both spawn and worker mode:
  `value_transfers_cli` 29/39, `cli` 21/71, `compile_verbs` 2/12,
  `spec_verbs` 4/49 — the same test names in both modes.
- `tcl-cli-support` lib: `highlight::tests::original_highlight_uses_actual_c_jim_and_irules_lexical_axes`
  fails on the base commit.
- `tcl-compiler` has two dead-code warnings, so `clippy -D warnings` fails
  before reaching downstream crates.
- Drift gates failing on the base commit (each also fails run alone):
  `kcs-index-links`, `owner-resolution`, `resolution-drift`,
  `retired-api-gate`, `value-transfers --check`, `registry-axes --check`,
  `command-backing --check`, `callback-inventory --check`.

## 1. CLI start-ups in tests

What changed:

- `tcl __tcl-cli-worker <dir> <slot>` serves invocations from one process
  (`tcl_cli::serve_worker`, `tcl_cli_support::worker::serve`). Verb output goes
  through `tcl_cli_support::sink`; `tcl-cli` denies `clippy::print_stdout` and
  `clippy::print_stderr`.
- `tcl_cli_support::worker::output` is the client. `cli.rs`, `compile_verbs.rs`,
  `value_transfers_cli.rs` and the environment-free command in `spec_verbs.rs`
  use it through `reused_output()`. `pkg_*` tests keep real processes: each
  test sets its own `HOME`/`TCL_VENV`, so a worker would serve one call.
- Commands that differed only by a throwaway path now share one environment:
  `absent_config_home()` is one never-created directory per test binary, the
  `Scratch` fixture uses it, and each truth-table pass rewrites one
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` per row (the CLI reads `config.ini` afresh per run).
- `callgraph_reads_a_cr_terminated_tcl_document_the_way_the_editor_does`
  compares two runs' opaque `bodyKey`s, which carry a process-wide counter, so
  it runs real processes (`run_fresh_tcl_on_scratch_doc`).
- `tcl_cli_support::cli_packs` keys its cache on the current directory as well
  as the demand generation, because a worker changes directory per request.

Measured on 4 vCPU, debug profile without debuginfo:

| | spawn (before) | workers (after) |
|---|---|---|
| `tcl` starts, `value_transfers_cli` + `cli` | 394 | 22 (one process per test, nextest-style) |
| `value_transfers_cli` wall, 4 threads | 174 s | 125 s (110 s one process per test) |
| `cli` wall, 4 threads | 145 s | 51 s test time (60 s one process per test) |
| one `tcl opt --profile full` on one line | ~1.6 s | 0.3–0.4 s warm, ~1.9 s first |

Pass/fail sets are identical between modes in all four suites, in both the
libtest and the one-process-per-test runs. Logs:
`/tmp/claude-0/…/scratchpad/w/{spawn,worker2,worker3,pp}-*.log`.

Open:

- 29 of 39 `value_transfers_cli` tests fail early on the base commit, so its
  speed-up is understated until they pass and run all their invocations.
- 12 pools remain in `cli.rs`, each a test that sets its own global config.
- Per-request cost (0.3–0.4 s for `opt --profile full` on one line) is now the
  floor; it is verb work, not start-up.

## 2. `rust-check`

What changed:

- `cargo xtask batch '<gate argv>' …` runs subcommands in one process and
  fails if any failed; `make xtask-gates` runs the 35 single-command gates of
  `xtask-check` through it (`XTASK_GATES`). The individual `xtask-*` targets
  remain.
- `rust-check` is a matrix job with legs `lint` (`make rust-check-lint` =
  `check-rust-pr`) and `drift` (`make rust-check-drift` = `xtask-check`), each
  with its own rust-cache key. `make rust-check` is still exactly both, and
  `scripts/dev/test-pr-gate-path.sh` holds the legs, `fail-fast: false` and
  the Makefile union, with negative controls for each.

Measured: the 35 gates take 413 s in one batch locally, of which
`kcs-index-links` is 243 s (it reads 3,472 markdown files, 2,630 of them under
`docs/design/analysis`) and `owner-resolution` 81 s. Run alone, a gate also
pays cargo's start-up and cold caches: `callback-inventory` 5.2 s alone against
1.0 s in the batch, `registry-axes` 13.2 s against 9.4 s.

Open:

- Confirm on the first CI run that the TomMath fetch ended the
  `tcl-runtime`/`xtask` rebuild loop (`Compiling tcl-runtime` should appear
  once per leg) and record both legs' durations.
- `kcs-index-links` is now the drift leg's long pole; see item 3.

## 3. Repository weight

The evidence prune on `work` (`8ab317a`, a separate workstream) took the
tracked tree from 10.7 GB in 127,281 files to 0.34 GB in 39,003, and
`docs/**/*.md` from 3,472 files to 1,847 (`kcs-index-links` read all of them).

`make check-tracked-size`, part of `xtask-check` and so of CI's `rust-check
(drift)` leg, fails when a tracked file exceeds 10 MiB or the tracked tree
exceeds 1 GiB. A file a build or test reads may be listed in
`scripts/dev/tracked-size-allowlist.txt`; an entry that no longer names an
oversized file fails too. The largest tracked file today is 8.8 MiB
(`rust/tcl-compiler/tests/data/native_brace_expression/named-row-audit.json`).

Open:

- History still carries the old blobs: a full clone, or a shallow clone of an
  old commit, downloads them. Only a history rewrite removes them; that is the
  owner's call.
- Re-time `kcs-index-links` after the prune (243 s against the old tree).

## 4. Splitting `tcl-compiler`

A balanced split is not available as a move: the production code (about
338k of the crate's 908k lines; the rest is `#[cfg(test)]`) is one strongly
connected module graph of 97 modules and 330k lines. Even `ir` reaches
`analyser`, `command_binding` and `lowering`. Any further split first needs
cycles broken by design.

The one slice that comes out with few cut edges is the back end, now the
`tcl-codegen` crate: `codegen` (30k production + 22k test lines), `inlining`
and `compile_service`. It depends on `tcl-compiler`; nothing in
`tcl-compiler` depends on it.

- Edges cut: the list/format folds and `command_text` moved down into
  `tcl_compiler::codegen_helpers` (re-exported as `codegen::helpers`); the
  native-entry configuration helpers moved into `command_binding`
  (`compile_service` delegates); doc links became plain text.
- About 150 crate-private items that the emitters use became
  `#[doc(hidden)] pub`: the emitters always used `tcl-compiler` internals.
- Tests: emitter tests that lived in `tcl-compiler` moved to
  `tcl-codegen` — 19 integration test files and an example, plus unit
  tests in `src/tests`. Fixtures they need from `tcl-compiler` are
  behind its `test-support` feature (enabled only by `tcl-codegen`'s
  dev-dependency); fixtures that hold a VM live in
  `tcl_codegen::test_support`, since `tcl-compiler` cannot depend on
  `tcl-vm`.
- CI: the shard map re-keys the moved binaries and adds 22 rows, 19 of
  which were missing on the base commit (`verify-nextest-binary-shards.py
  --metadata-only` now passes: 417 targets). `wasm-real-link` runs
  `-p tcl-codegen`; the `lsp_wasm`, GitHub Pages and SpecTcl-compat path
  filters include `rust/tcl-codegen`. The five separately locked WASM crates
  gained the new package in their lockfiles, and nothing else.

Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features` is clean
apart from two dead-code warnings already on the base; `tcl-vm-wasm` checks
for the host. `tcl-codegen`'s tests run; no failure is a missing fixture or
path.

Parity: the same tests run on the base commit `4be8d9f` (as `tcl-compiler`
unit and integration tests) and on the split (as `tcl-codegen` tests), compared
by binary and test name: 1,529 tests in 21 binaries, **no outcome changed** in
either direction. The work tip's existing failures (for example
`fixture body "::p" absent`) are the same tests on both sides. The 37 former
`codegen::helpers` tests run in `tcl-compiler` with `codegen_helpers`.
Logs: `/tmp/claude-0/…/scratchpad/split/{codegen-tests,base-integ,base-lib}.log`.

Naming and ownership gates. The split first took the emitters out of the
drift gates' scan roots, so they quietly stopped checking moved code. Now:

- `rust/tcl-codegen/src` is a root of `util::ANALYSIS_TIER_ROOTS`
  (`value-transfers`, `registry-axes`), `dialect-drift`'s document crates and
  `diag-emission`'s search roots; `retired-api-gate`'s owned patterns that
  covered the compiler's codegen cover `tcl-codegen`.
- The owner-resolution source manifest records 47 rows the split invalidated:
  rows whose owner and consumer both moved name the `tcl-codegen` package, and
  owners widened to `#[doc(hidden)] pub` record their actual visibility. Only
  rows that pass on the base were touched.
- Four source routes now cross from `tcl-codegen` into `tcl-compiler`, which
  the route checker cannot follow; they are listed beside the manifest. Two
  owners keep verified in-crate routes; `original_literal_argument_data_for_module`
  and `matches_foreach_header` have no checked consumer route until the checker
  resolves `tcl_compiler::` paths.
- The moved test code lives in `tcl-codegen/src/tests/`, the path every gate
  already treats as tests.

Result, run on the base `4be8d9f` and on the split and compared with line
numbers ignored: `owner-resolution`, `resolution-drift`,
`segmentation-drift`, `dialect-drift`, `number-drift`, `retired-api-gate`,
`catalogue-callers`, `value-transfers`, `registry-axes`, `callback-inventory`,
`command-backing` and `diag-emission-check` report the same findings and exit
codes on both. Clippy on `tcl-compiler` matches the base too: the 44 widened
functions carry `#[must_use]`.

Open:

- Teach the source-route checker cross-crate `tcl_compiler::` routes, so the
  two unchecked routes above become checked (naming workstream's gate).
- Re-time a cold library build against the base.
