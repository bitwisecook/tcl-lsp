# Centralised name handling on work

Implementation has resumed from `554085e`. Ninety baseline catalogue units
have reviewed changes pending complete validation: 36 code units and all 54
authored-documentation units. **Zero units are verified complete**. All **2,158**
baseline units remain unverified or unimplemented (2,068 have no integrated
implementation yet). Six additional demonstrated owner/provider requirements
have a bounded reconciliation proposal, pending root catalogue integration.
Development checkpoint `2a86f7dfd` is pushed to `work`. The last clean-source
Runtime build at `2459c9924` passes: selected continuation/import/Length controls
are 28 PASS. Broader namespace controls are 160 PASS/5 FAIL and variable-name
controls 37 PASS/6 FAIL. All eleven failures repeat with explicit original
providers. Original failures and exact strict reruns remain retained.
The workspace build at `2a86f7dfd` failed six new VM fixture private-method calls;
the fixtures now use existing original APIs or an explicit test-only constructed
storage fixture, with unchanged assertions. Full compilation/reruns remain open.
The current proof checker reports 3,574 errors: missing retained payload references,
stale census/evidence digests and source/binding/document drift. These have not
been relabelled accepted or repaired by blindly updating hashes.
Exact selected logs/source hashes are in the compact durable
[control capture](../../../experiments/name-handling/results/owner-adoption-20261016/records.json).
The [provider capture](../../../experiments/name-handling/oracles/provider-pairing-20261016/capture.json)
authenticates all six installed C/Jim setup pairings, without semantic acceptance.
Alias edit authority, class collection transport and Jim physical body-result
ownership remain open. Further owner-facet and baseline validation-repair count
reconciliation is explicit; historical M12 stays unchanged. Chat reports use
30-minute intervals; implementation and acceptance remain separate.

The source/role audit is complete for **110,709 tracked baseline paths**, with explicit current-source annexes and zero unexamined paths. The reconciled catalogue contains **1,321 caller migrations**, **377 shared-owner repairs/extensions** and **101 metadata/target-schema changes**: **1,799 semantic code changes**. There are separately **305 validation-code repairs** and **54 authored-documentation corrections**, making **2,158 confirmed required changes**. These remain to be implemented. Examined requirements and original/provider provenance questions remain separate.

The [beginner API and integration guide](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_87188db946408191aa04822f5b653a90) explains dialects, SSA/SCCP, arrays and dictionaries with diagrams.

Keep written source, evaluated names, namespace identity, command slots, live command identity, variable places/cells and display text distinct. Shared owners retain original bytes, spans, complete configuration, source ownership, namespace/frame/interpreter context and lifetimes/generations. A display string cannot reconstruct identity. Source advice grants no Native execution, physical cell, entered frame, absence, edit/optimisation authority or normal completion. Repair missing owner transport instead of weakening guards or adding String inverses.

One change means one actual integration boundary with a distinct purpose. Count a genuinely missing shared-owner facet once, then each caller whose code must separately change. Unchanged callers, raw purpose rows, filenames, source anchors, repair families, open issues and existing tests are not migration counts. S/M/L/XL describes relative scope and coupling, not days.

Before the final PR, move useful contracts and real experiments/tests into durable locations. Correct documentation/comments across the entire tracked repository, including generated guidance and files outside the implementation diff. Remove obsolete guidance, completed TODOs, development narratives, temporary ledgers/prompts/archives and their references, including this directory and the work-specific AGENTS exception. Preserve reproducible evidence and legal attribution. Complete all gates before creating a ready-to-merge PR; do not merge. This final cleanup is still required and is not completed by source-audit closure.
