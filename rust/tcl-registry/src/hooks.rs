//! Hook type definitions for compiler integration.

//! Hooks let command-specific specialisation slot into lowering and
//! codegen without baking command names into the compiler. The
//! registry stores a typed identifier on each [`crate::CommandSpec`]
//! / [`crate::SubCommand`]; the compiler maps that identifier to its
//! algorithm. Identifiers are exhaustive enums so a new compiler
//! pass cannot accidentally accept an arbitrary integer.

/// Typed identifier for a lowering specialisation.
///
/// The compiler keeps the implementations; the registry keeps the
/// catalogue of which command form picks which implementation.
/// Variants are stable enum members rather than bare integers so a
/// `match` on this type is exhaustively checked at every dispatcher
/// — adding a new hook here gives the compiler a deliberate
/// compile-time error until the new arm is implemented.
